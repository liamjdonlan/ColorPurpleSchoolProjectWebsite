            "Celie’s pants are simply amazing. The blue and red pants she gave
            me allowed me much greater freedom to live a life singing on the
            road. The pants were resistant to wrinkles so I could pack them
            without worry, they could stretch to a larger size in case I got a
            bit of a stomach from too much food on the road, and they go great
            with outfits that I sing in. It would be much more difficult for me
            to live my life if I didn't have Celie’s pants." -

            "Celie made me outstanding pants and they have allowed me to be much
            more free to live my life as a parent. They have pockets that allow
            me to carry my children's possessions, they fit close around the leg
            allowing me to run after my children or quickly help them if they
            are in need, and they are washable so I can get out any stains that
            might arise as a result of my parenting responsibilities. These
            pants are liberating and I live a fuller life because of them." -

            "Celie’s pants are simply superb. Although I didn’t get to use them
            for their intended purpose, it was clear that the thought Celie puts
            into her pants is incredible. Celie made me pants that she intended
            for me to wear during my missionary trip in Africa. The pants would
            have allowed me to be much more free to fulfill my responsibilities
            during the mission. With the pants I would have been unencumbered by
            the heat of the location in which I lived as they are white to
            reflect the heat and thin to further ensure they don't get too warm.
            Furthermore they have an easily adjustable drawstring waist making
            them very practical to wear. My life during the mission certainly
            would have been a lot easier if I had Celie's pants." -
