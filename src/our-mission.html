          The goal of Folkspants limited is to give freedom and opportunity to
          other people. We achieve this in a variety of ways. First we break
          gender stereotypes by selling unisex pants that can be worn by people
          of any gender; this allows people to be more free by choosing what
          they would want to wear instead of what society believes they should
          wear. Second, we provide jobs to women in a time when few were
          available and allow them to be financially independent. Third, our
          pants are custom made to allow people to live their lives more freely.
          For example, they have introduced a new line of pants for pregnant
          women allowing them to live their lives uninhibited. If you want to
          see more specific examples of how we enable people to be free in their
          lives, see our glowing reviews on the home page.
