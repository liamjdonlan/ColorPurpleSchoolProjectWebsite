          <h2>Celie</h2>
          <p>
            Celie started making pants during a very difficult period of her
            life. She had learned that learned that her husband had kept all
            news of her sister from her for many years. Therefore, Celie started
            making pants in order to focus on something other than her
            frustration. Not only did making pants lessen Celie’s anger, they
            had numerous other benefits on her life. Despite living a very
            difficult life living with an abusive stepfather, abusive husband,
            and being separated from her sister for many years, making pants
            provided Celie with a source of happiness. Celie loved making pants
            and would make pair after pair after pair. Eventually, Celie turned
            her hobby into a business and was able to become financially
            independent. Furthermore, Celie’s pants gave her greater self
            confidence and allowed her to support other people as well.

        <h2>Jerene and Darlene</h2>
        <p>
          Jerene and Darlene help Celie with the sowing business. They are
          single, independent, and self supporting women which was rare during
          this time. They were likely able to gain their freedom and
          independence through their job at Folkspants which provides them with
          money to support themselves.
